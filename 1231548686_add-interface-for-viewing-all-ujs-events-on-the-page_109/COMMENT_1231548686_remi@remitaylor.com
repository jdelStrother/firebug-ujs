... would be cool if we could show the count/number of all of the UJS events on the page, too - if it were in a very visible place that we could click on to get to the event list ... that would be cool!

to start with ... maybe just show "this page has # events" in the panel where we show the selected element's events?

might rely on switching to ujs="ID"
